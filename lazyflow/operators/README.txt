 as of 14.01.2012 all operators use a old and obsolete api
 that we are currently in the process of replacing with a 
 better and more flexible one.

 DO NOT LOOK AT THE SOURCE COIDE OF THESE OLD AND OBSOLETE OPERATORS !!!!!!

 please wait instead until the operators are ported to the new api
 and the tutorials are updated to reflect the api changes.
